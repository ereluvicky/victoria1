        <h3>Where We Work</h3>
        we work mainly in sub saharan areas because we feel,
        polio is a bigger killer to them.
        The news of the recent attacks by herdsmen on some communities in Benue State almost took the shine off other equally critical issues in the country, particularly the rising incidences of kidnapping across the country. From the South to the North, there is always one case or two of kidnapping somewhere. It is a damning verdict on the security architecture of the country.

The news of the death of a member of the Taraba State House of Assembly, Hon. Hosea Ibi, whose body was found days after an undisclosed amount of money was allegedly paid as ransom, was actually very disturbing. ––– And days after, four expatriates (two Americans and two Canadians) were reportedly abducted in a northern state.

This is a serious challenge to the security agencies in the country. It is not to say they are not working hard to get round the situation, perhaps, they are not doing enough. Should the situation continue, Nigeria may be declared very unsafe for investment by the international community and that would amount to failure on the part of government as an entity, the very reason security agencies should buckle up and rise up to this challenge. It is very worrisome!.
